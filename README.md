Hello! This is a portfolio of all of my projects, completed and in development. 

Each of my projects will be listed below with a short excerpt detailing what I've used to create them and their functionality

--LeagueStatTracker

League Stat Tracker was a full stack project I developed independently. The project is a multi-page web application designed to pull video game data from the Riot web developer API then format, and present that data to an end user.

I use A Java Spring Boot backend and for the frontend I used Vue.js, vue router, and the Vuex store.

--LeetCodeWorkspace

LeetCode Workspace is less of an independent application and more of a demonstration. I started using it recently so that I could have all of my previous solutions in one place, so I could return and optimize solutions I've already completed at a later date.

--RecipeSaver

Recipe Saver is a work in progress, but my end goal is for it to be a web application that allows users to write, save, and search recipes written by themselves, or other users. 

I intend to use Java Spring Boot, the JDBC API, and SQL in the backend to both handle my database calls, and my outgoing API responses. For the frontend I intend to use Vue.js, vue router, and the Vuex store.

--TE Projects

TE Projects is a folder containing 5 separate projects I worked on while attending the TechElevator bootcamp. In Module 1 we worked on programming basics and backend Java development. In Module 2 we worked on SQL, databases, and MVC architecture. In model 3 we worked on frontend development including Javascript, vue.js, and Vuex.
